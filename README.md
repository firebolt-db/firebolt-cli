Firebolt cli is a tool for connecting to firebolt, managing firebolt resources, and executing queries from the command line.

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites
`python>=3.7` and `pip` should be installed beforehand. For this go to [Python official page](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 

Also, you will need a firebolt account with information about username, password, database, and engine. For more information go to [Firebolt](https://firebolt.io).

### Installation
Once you have all prerequisites in place, you can install the firebolt cli via pip:
```shell
$ pip install firebolt-cli
```

To verify the installation run:
```shell
$ firebolt --version

firebolt, version 0.2.0
```

### Running
The next step is to configure the firebolt cli:
```shell
$ firebolt configure

Username [None]: your_username
Password [None]: ********
Account name [None]: your_firebolt_account_name
Database name [None]: your_database
Engine name or URL [None]: your_engine_name_or_url
Successfully updated firebolt-cli configuration
```

To run your first query, the engine has to be running. Check the status of the engine by executing the following command:
```shell
$ firebolt engine status your_engine_name

Engine your_engine_name current status is: ENGINE_STATUS_SUMMARY_STOPPED
```

If the engine is stopped, you have to start the engine by executing the following command:
```shell
$ firebolt engine start your_engine_name --wait

Engine your_engine_name is successfully started
```

Now you are ready to run your first query, this could be done by opening the interactive query 
```
$ firebolt query

Connection succeded
firebolt> SELECT * FROM your_table LIMIT 5;

|   l_orderkey |   l_partkey |   l_suppkey | l_shipdate   |

## Usage

With firebolt cli you can manage the databases and engines, as well as run SQL quires.
```
$ firebolt --help

Usage: firebolt [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Firebolt command line utility.

Options:
  -V, --version  Show the version and exit.
  --help         Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  configure (config)  Store firebolt configuration parameters in config file
  database (db)       Manage the databases
  engine              Manage the engines
  query               Execute sql queries
```
For more information about a specific command use flag `--help`, e.g. `firebolt database create --help`.

### Configure 
There are three ways to configure firebolt cli:
1. Run `firebolt config` and setting all parameters from STDIN.

Or you can set particular parameters by running configure with additional command-line arguments:
```shell
$ firebolt config --username your_user_name --account-name firebolt
```

2. Pass additional command-line arguments to each command.

```shell
$ firebolt query --username your_user_name \
                 --engine-name your_running_engine
```

3. Use environment variable
```shell
$ export FIREBOLT_USERNAME=your_username
$ export FIREBOLT_PASSWORD=your_password
$ export FIREBOLT_ACCOUNT_NAME=your_account_name
$ export FIREBOLT_API_ENDPOINT=api_endpoint
$ export FIREBOLT_ENGINE_NAME_URL=your_engine_name_or_url
$ export FIREBOLT_ACCESS_TOKEN=access_token
$ firebolt query
```

### Interactive SQL
To enter interactive SQL, firebolt CLI has to be configured using one of three methods from [configuration section](#configure).
Then simply run 
```
$ firebolt query

firebolt> .help
.exit     Exit firebolt-cli
.help     Show this help message
.quit     Exit firebolt-cli
.tables   Show tables in current database
firebolt>
```

Interactive SQL mode also supports multiline commands and multiple statements;  
```
firebolt> SELECT * FROM your_table
     ...> ORDER BY l_shipdate
     ...> LIMIT 2;
+--------------+-------------+-------------+--------------+
|   l_orderkey |   l_partkey |   l_suppkey | l_shipdate   |

```

### Managing resources
With `firebolt-cli` it is also possible to manage databases and engines, for the full set of available features please see `firebolt engine --help` and `firebolt database --help`.

### Ingestion
`firebolt-cli` also offers data ingestion functionality. For more information see [INGEST_GETTING_STARTED.md](https://github.com/firebolt-db/firebolt-cli/blob/main/INGEST_GETTING_STARTED.md).

### Enable shell completion
Firebolt provides tab completion for Bash (version 4.4 and up), Zsh, and Fish. In order to enable the completion for your environment you have to follow one of the steps below.

#### Bash
Add this to ~/.bashrc:
```shell
eval "$(_FIREBOLT_COMPLETE=bash_source firebolt)"
```

#### Zsh
Add this to ~/.zshrc:
```shell
eval "$(_FIREBOLT_COMPLETE=zsh_source firebolt)"
```

#### Fish
Add this to ~/.config/fish/completions/firebolt.fish:

```shell
eval (env _FIREBOLT_COMPLETE=fish_source firebolt)
```

The completion in `firebolt-cli` is based on `Click` library. For more information please visit `Click` [documentation](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/shell-completion/#enabling-completion).

## Docker
To start the work with docker, 
you should first pull the docker from the repository.
```shell
docker pull ghcr.io/firebolt-db/firebolt-cli:latest
```

Afterward, you will be able to run the cli and passing all configuration variables as environment variables. 

Here is an example of getting a list of available engines: 
```shell
docker run -e FIREBOLT_USERNAME="your_username"\
           -e FIREBOLT_PASSWORD="your_password"\  
           ghcr.io/firebolt-db/firebolt-cli:latest engine list
```
